# Cashfree iOS SDK (CashfreePGCoreSDK)

Hey! fellow developers, welcome to Cashfree's Documentation Site. Now that you are here, we believe that you are looking to integrate our payment gateway into your iOS application. This documentation will guide you through the entire integration process.

## Getting Started

Use our **CashfreePGCoreSDK** to integrate the Cashfree's Payment Gateway directly into your app for **iOS 11** and above. It has been designed to offload the complexity of handling and integrating payments in your app.

The following are the steps to be followed to getting the integration started:-

1. Create an account with Cashfree and get the API keys
2. Integrate our Cashfree SDK into your application
3. Create an order with Cashfree
4. Create a **session**.
5. Select a **payment mode** and create objects for the same.
6. Create a **payment object**.
5. Initiate payment

___

## **Step 1: Create an account with Cashfree and get the API keys**

1. Go to the [Cashfree website](https://merchant.cashfree.com/merchant/login) and create an account. Click [here](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/create-account) for detailed steps on how to create and activate your account.
2. Log in to your Merchant Dashboard using the same credentials.
3. Click Payment Gateway section View Dashboard click Credentials. For security purposes, you need to enter your password for verification.
4. Copy the app ID and the secret key. These values are required to create the order token from your server. Order tokens are used to authenticate the API calls made from Cashfree iOS SDK.

___

## **Step 2: Integrate Cashfree SDK into your application**

#### COCOAPODS

Open your pod file and add the following and then use `pod install`

```
pod 'CashfreePGCoreSDK', '~> 1.0.0'
```
___

## **Step 3: Creating an order with Cashfree**

To process any payment on Cashfree PG, the merchant needs to create an order in the cashfree system. **This order must be created from your backend (as it uses your secret key)**.

`Note:` Please refer our [Order Creation](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/create-order) for more details regarding parameters and more.

    "payment_link": "https://cashfree.com/pgbillpaywebapp/#W8zVBhADaw2EDP7crdyM" // This link opens the payment page provided by Cashfree
}
```
If the order creation is successful you will receive a 200 response and the order entity in response. This order entity contains relevant details for the order and the details provided in the request.

We recommend that you store the following parameters at your end `order_id`, `cf_order_id` , `order_token`, and the `order_status`. Please refer [Order Creation Response](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/create-order#response) page for more details.

`Note:` The **`order_token`** contains all the order details and has to be sent to the SDK while initiating the payment.

___

## Step 4: **Create a session**

As discussed above, the **`order_token`** contains all the order details and is used to authenticate the payment. The SDK exposes a class **`CFSession`** which has member variables for a payment session. One of them sets the order_token value.

Cashfree provides two environments, one being the `sandbox` environment for developers to test the payment flow and responses and the other being `production` environment which gets shipped to production. This environment can be set in this session object.

The values for environment can be either `.SANDBOX` or `.PRODUCTION`.

#### **Code Snippet**
```
do {
     let cfSession = try CFSession.CFSessionBuilder()
                .setEnvironment(.SANDBOX)
                .setOrderToken("order_token")
                .setOrderId("order_Id")
                .build()
   } catch let e {
     let error = e as! CashfreeError
     print(error.localizedDescription)
   }
```

`Note:` Refer to our API Reference documentation for more information about the methods.

___

## **Prerequisite - Card, Wallet and Netbanking Mode**

When any of these payment modes is being used, the user is navigated to a web page to authenticate the payment. In this case, a web-view has to be loaded. For this purpose, the SDK exposes a web-view `CFWebView` which is a subclass of `WKWebView`. You have to create a WKWebView and set the custom class to `CFWebView`.

```
var cashfreeWebView: CFWebView!
 override func viewDidLoad() {
     super.viewDidLoad()

     .......

     self.cashfreeWebView = CFWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: WKWebViewConfiguration())
     self.cashfreeWebView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
     self.view.addSubview(cashfreeWebView)
     self.cashfreeWebView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
     self.cashfreeWebView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
     self.cashfreeWebView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true
     self.cashfreeWebView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor, constant: 0).isActive = true

     do {
         try self.cfWebView.startAuthentication()
     } catch let e {
         let error = e as! CashfreeError
         print(error.localizedDescription)
     }
 }
```

___

## **Step 5: Select a **payment mode** and create objects for the same**

Cashfree PG provides multiple modes to make payment. You can choose any mode depending on the requirement and invoke that payment mode from the SDK. The following are supported by the iOS SDK:-

1. Card
2. Netbanking
3. UPI Collect
4. UPI Intent
5. Wallet
6. EMI

---

### **Create a Card Object**

- A card object has to be created by sending all the required details i.e., Card Holder Name, Card Number, Card CVV and more
- The SDK exposes a class `CFCard` that collects these details.
- The below code snippet creates an object of `CFCard`

```
do {
        let card = try CFCard.CFCardBuilder()
            .setCardNumber("1234")
            .setCardHolderName("Suhas")
            .setCardExpiryYear("25") // in YY format
            .setCardExpiryMonth("12")
            .setCVV("123")
            .buildCard()

    } catch let e {
        let error = e as! CashfreeError
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
```

- In order to establish a 2-way communication, the SDK exposes a protocol that is coupled tightly with card-payment flow and the controller which is initiating this has to conform to the protocol `CFCardPaymentDelegate`.

- This protocol comprises of 4 methods:
    - `func initiatingCardPayment()`
    - `func presentWebForAuthenticatingCardPayment()`
    - `func cardPayment(didFinishExecutingWith error: CFErrorResponse)`
    - `func verifyCardPaymentCompletion(for orderId: String)`

`Note:` Refer to our API Reference documentation for more information about the methods.

                .setChannel("phonepe")
                .setPhone("99999999")
                .build()
        } catch let e {
            let error = e as! CashfreeError
            print(error.localizedDescription)
       }
```

### **Create a UPI Object**

- A UPI object has to be created by sending all the required details i.e., channel and UPI ID
- The SDK exposes a class `CFUPI` that collects these details.
- Cashfree provides 2 modes of payment with UPI. One being the `collect` flow and the other being the `intent` flow.
- In the `collect` flow, the user has to enter his/her UPI ID and a request will be sent to that UPI ID to complete the payment.
- In the `intent` flow, the user has to be presented with a list of all installed UPI applications present in the phone. Clicking on one of them, the user will be redirected to the application to complete the payment
- Depending on the requirement, you can choose to use any.

#### The below code snippet creates an object of `CFUPI` collect.

```
        do {
            let cfUPICollect = try CFUPI.CFUPIBuilder()
                .setChannel(.COLLECT)
                .setUpiId("test@gocashfree")
                .build()
        } catch let e {
            let error = e as! CashfreeError
            print(error.localizedDescription)
       }
```
#### Pre-requisite for UPI Intent

- The SDK exposes a util class `CFUPIUtils` which consists of a method `getInstalledUPIApplications()` that returns a list of all the installed UPI applications in the user's phone.
- Add the following permission to `info.plist`

```xml
<key>LSApplicationCategoryType</key>
<string></string>
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>bhim</string>
  <string>paytm</string>
  <string>phonepe</string>
  <string>tez</string>
</array>
```

```
let upiApplications = CFUPIUtils().getInstalledUPIApplications() // Returns an array ([[String: String]])
```
#### The below code snippet creates an object of `CFUPI` intent
```
do {
            let cfUPICollect = try CFUPI.CFUPIBuilder()
                .setChannel(.INTENT)
                .setUpiId("id") // Here you have to send the "id" of the app that was clicked from the list that you received earlier
                .build()
        } catch let e {
            let error = e as! CashfreeError
            print(error.localizedDescription)
       }
```
`Note:` In the above code-snippet, inside the `setUpiId()`, the id of the clicked application has to be sent. This `id` is the key that is present in the list of objects that was retrieved in the above **Prerequisites**

- In order to establish a 2-way communication, the SDK exposes a protocol that is coupled tightly with upi-payment flow and the controller which is initiating this has to conform to the protocol `CFUPIPaymentDelegate`.

## Initiate payment

- Finally to initiate the payment, the above created Payment Object has to be sent to the SDK.
- The SDK exposes a class `CFPaymentGatewayService`, which can be used to set the Payment Object and initiate the payment.
- The below code snippet is an example demonstrating it's usage:

```
let gatewayService = CFPaymentGatewayService.getInstance()

override func viewDidLoad() {
  // We recommend that the callbacks be set separately in the viewDidLoad
  gatewayService.setCallback([self, self, self, self]) // One for each payment mode
}



do {
   try gatewayService.doPayment(payment: cardPaymentObject)
} catch let e {
  let error = e as! CashfreeError
  print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

`Note:` In the `doPayment()`, you can send the payment object of any of the above created payment mode (CFCardPayment, CFNetbankingPayment, CFWalletPayment, CFUPIPayment)

`Note:` Refer to our API Reference documentation for more information about the methods.

## Error Codes

There are 2 error codes that is sent from SDK to the application. One being the error code that is sent from Cashfree's Backend service when order initiation fails. Visit [here](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/resources#errors) for details about such error codes.

The other type of error codes are the ones that are exposed by the SDK when required data is not sent to the SDK when initiating the payment. These are thrown as error.

**CashfreeError** is an Enum that inherits  Foundations **Error** class. The following are some of the error codes that are exposed by the SDK:
